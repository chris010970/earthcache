# earthcache 

Demonstration of client functionality to query and download commercial satellite imagery using [SkyWatch EarthCache API](https://www.skywatch.com/satellite-imagery-api). 

SkyWatch EarthCache is a cloud-based platform operating as a 'one stop shop' for programmatically procuring high resolution, multispectral imagery at affordable prices from [multiple satellite data providers](https://www.skywatch.com/data)

Notebooks demonstrate methodology for programmatically identifying and retrieving [Pleiades](https://github.com/chris010970/earthcache/blob/main/notebooks/pleiades.ipynb) and [SPOT](https://github.com/chris010970/earthcache/blob/main/notebooks/spot.ipynb) RGB image time series collocated with an arbitrary AOI via EarthCache platform using the [client](https://github.com/chris010970/earthcache/blob/main/src/client.py) class implemented for this study.
